I. Perform with every chapter:
    1. Proofread the chapter and correct any mistakes, misspellings, grammar, etc.
    2. Extract the chapter's number (referred to as `chapter` from hear on out) from the chapter's first, second, or third line.
    3. Extract the chapter's title (referred to as `title` from hear on out) from the chapter's first, second, or third line.
